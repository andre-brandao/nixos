* What is Ranger?
[[https://ranger.github.io/][Ranger]] is a minimalistic TUI file manager controlled with vim keybindings (making it /extremely/ efficient).

If you've never tried a terminal file manager, I suggest you try it out. Here's a quick overview of how to work with it:
- =j= and =k= - Move up and down
- =l= - Move into a directory or open file at point
- =h= - Move up a directory
- =g g= - Move to top
- =G= - Move to bottom
- =SPC= - Mark a file
- =y y= - Copy (yank) file(s)
- =d d= - Cut file(s)
- =p p= - Paste file(s)
- =d T= - Trash file(s)
- =d D= - /Delete/ a file (no undo!)
- =!= - Run a shell command in current directory
- =@= - Run a shell command on file(s)
- =Ctrl-r= - Refresh view

Just like in vim, commands can be given by typing a colon =:= (semicolons =;= also work in ranger!) and typing the command, i.e =:rename newfilename=.
