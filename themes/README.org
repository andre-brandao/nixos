#+title: My Themes
#+author: Emmet

Inside this directory are all of my themes!

Each theme directory stores a few relevant files:
- =${theme-name}.yaml= - This stores all 16 colors for the theme
- =backgroundurl.txt= - A direct link to the wallpaper associated with the theme
- =backgroundsha26.txt= - =sha256sum= of the wallpaper
- =polarity.txt= - Whether or not the background is =light= or =dark=
- =${theme-name}.png= - A screenshot of the theme for previewing purposes

Look at any of the directories here for more info!
